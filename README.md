# Project 2: Guess the Flag

> "The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page." - Saint Augustine

If you're like me, you love to travel. That's why we've created this small game to encourage people to learn more about the world around them.

This Swift-based iOS app challenges users to guess the flag of a country based on a random selection. With features like array shuffling, random number generation, and UIAlertController, the app offers an interactive experience while reinforcing fundamental Swift and UIKit skills.

## Topics Covered:

- Asset Catalogs
- UIButton and CALayer
- Array Shuffling
- Random Number Generation
- @IBAction
- UIAlertController

## Challenges:

- Explore additional customizations and features for an enhanced user experience.
- Implement a scoring system and track user progress.
- Experiment with UI improvements or additional functionalities.

Feel free to fork, clone, or contribute to this project. Let's make learning about the world a fun and engaging experience!
